About the data: 

The code uses the following data included in the repo:

- X_train.txt: Training data set.
- X_test.txt: Test data set.
- features.txt: list of 561 features analyzed.
- y_train.txt: Train labels
- y_test.txt': Test labels
- subject_train.txt/subject_test.txt: Subject labels. Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

The user should set a working directory containing this files.

About the code:

This code consists of the following parts:

- The first part merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- The second part labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- The third part extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- The fourth part names the activities in the dataset
- The fifth part includes the subjects IDs in the dataset
- The last part creates a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

About the variables:

To conduct the analyzes, the following variables were created:

- train:  Data frame with the train set.
- test:  Data frame with the test set.
- merge: Data frame made from the merger of the train and test set. This data frame is updated throughout the code to include activity data and subject numbers.
- features: data frame containing the names of the 561 features.
- names: vector with the names of the 561 features.
- extractmean: subset of merge that contains only the columns referring to the mean and standard deviation.
- extract: subset of extractmean without the columns referring to the mean frequency.
- activities_test: vector with the activities class labels of the test data set.
- activities_train: vector with the activities class labels of the train data set.
- activities: vector obtained by merging of activity_test and activity_train in which activity labels have been replaced with descriptive names.
- tidy_data: data set with the average of each feature for each activity and each subject.
